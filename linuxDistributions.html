			In order to understand the philosophy behind Linux and its distributions, we need to learn some basic facts about the creation of GNU/Linux.
			<br>
			GNU - short for "GNU's Not Unix!" - was a project started in 1983 by MIT computer scientist Richard Stallman with the goal of creating a completely free and open-source operating system, whose design would be based off the proprietary Unix.
			<br>
			The GNU operating system would, however, lack an actual kernel until 1991 when Helsinki computer science student Linus Torvalds published Linux (a portmentau of Linus and Unix), a Unix-like kernel which he developed as a hobby project.
			<br>
			The Linux kernel was published under the GNU GPL (GNU General Public License), a free software license created by Stallman, and its combination with the GNU utilities gave birth to the first free operating system
			<br>
			"Free" in this case means two things:
			<ol class="lead text-light">
				<li>The operating system itself is free to use - we do not need to pay for a license to use it</li>
				<li>The operating system's code is free for anyone to access</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p class="lead text-light">
			Ever since then, Linux started taking off in various fields of computing, being shipped in the form of various distributions - operating systems consisting of the base Linux kernel combined with all the necessary accessories (a package manager at the bare minimum)
			<br>
			The first distribution was Softlanding Linux System, followed by Slackware and Debian. Linux only started gaining traction as a desktop computer OS with the release of the desktop environments KDE and GNOME.
			<br>
			Distributions are often called distros for short.

Upon installation, Arch greets the user with nothing but a command line, the user being expected to install any further elements of the operating system themselves. This allows for a great degree of customization, examples of which you can see among the images below. Arch Linux also has a wiki with very extensive documentation, its own package manager called Pacman, and delivers updates in a rolling release model, meaning the user never has to reinstall the operating system to update. Usage of Arch is heavily dependent on the command line.</p>

As a result, the possibilities of optimizing one's software specifically for their machine are far greater than on other systems.
